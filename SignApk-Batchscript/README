  Content: Windows Batch Script for signing an 'update.zip' file

  Usage:   Save your /unsigned/ zip file as 'myupdate.zip' (without quotes) and
           doubleclick batch.bat. Shortly 'myupdate.zip' will be deleted and the
           /signed/ 'update.zip' appears; if not: refresh explorer.

           You also need SignApk application to use this batch script.
           You also have to generate certificates!

  License: I do not know exactly what License to choose, specially when I'm
           using third party software (e.g. the bootanimation itself) so I'd
           stick to that:

           You may modify and redistribute as long as you mention all it's authors.
           The package (mostly update.zip or similar) comes without any warranty,
           the authors are not responsible for the work.
		   
		   Due to my usage of newer software (like Android 4.0) this might not work on them.
		   I will re-release them, when I have tested them on ICS 4.0.

           Especially when flashing phones, YOU KNOW what you're doing and you also
           know, that there can happen strange things, which can cause your phone to
           get broken.
