  License: I do not know exactly what License to choose, specially when I'm
           using third party software (e.g. the bootanimation itself) so I'd
           stick to that:

           You may modify and redistribute as long as you mention all it's authors.
           The package (mostly update.zip or similar) comes without any warranty,

           Especially when flashing phones, YOU KNOW what you're doing and you also
           know, that there can happen strange things, which can cause your phone to
           get broken.
